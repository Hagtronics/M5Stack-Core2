This is the directory structure for VS Code running PlatformIO extension
See PlatformIO documentation for further help

This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:
  
|--lib  
|  |  
|  |--Core2_Sound  
|  |  |- Core2_Sounds.h  
|  |  |- Core2_sounds.c  
|  |  
|  |- README --> THIS FILE  
|  
|- platformio.ini  
|--src  
   |- main.c     

and a contents of `src/main.c`:
```
#include <Core2_Sounds.h>
int main (void)
{
  ...
}

```
